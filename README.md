## Usage

Strength can be set from 0 to 5. Strength represent number of blocks that would be filled with color and color of fill
ling(0 - nothing, 1 - red, 2 - orange, 3 - yellow, 4 - light green, 5 - dark green). Setting strength to more then 5 will make no difference from just setting it to 5.

```
PasswordStrength passwordStrength = new PasswordStrength();
passwordStrength.setStrength(4);
```
Setting strength to 4 mean will indicate good password strength. 

Common use case would be to track changes of PasswordField and then calculating and setting strength on every change: 
```
passwordField.addValueChangeListener(changeEvent -> {
    passwordStrength.setStrength(changeEvent.getValue().length() / 3);
});
```
